## Rules
The game slidy is a two player game with multiple levels. The game follows three basic rules: 
1. A __block__ (controled by the player) that can move and lay down a __set number of tiles__. 
2. Level is complete when __two player meet__ (adjacent to each other) and have __spent all their tiles__. 
3. A block can step on the __other player's tile__, but it can __never__ step on __itselves tile__. 
   * When that happends, the tile of player b is replaced by a tile of player a. 
   * In turn, the __player b will gain a tile__ while player a spend a tile. 

In game, the rules is phrased like the following with some artistic style to it: 
```
